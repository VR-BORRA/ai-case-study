## Payment Fraud
Payment fraud is increasing as fraudsters find new tactics to target their victims. Businesses need to enhance their fraud strategies to keep up with these new payment fraud trends. With the right technology, businesses can detect and prevent fraud faster and reduce its negative impact, leading to cost reduction, better customer experience, and higher revenue.

AI and other cutting-edge tech offer fraudsters brand-new tools, plus faster methods to employ tried-and-true techniques. AI and bots have made card enumeration, or brute force attacks, vastly more efficient — amounting to more than $1 billion of annual fraud losses. Criminals' bots can generate massive lists of potential credit card numbers, then leverage AI to rapidly test these values in online transactions until it finds a valid set of card data. 

AI has become increasingly effective at scamming real people. "Fraudsters are using generative AI (Gen AI) to conduct phishing attacks or socially engineer people into making payments or transferring funds to a fraudsters account.

Payment fraud has a negative impact on businesses. Here are a few of the consequences:
- Money lost
- Increased chargeback fees
- Reputational damage
- Legal and regulatory challenges
